-- This UPDATE query is for tables where at least one Option List is used
-- Values for where Option Lists are used will need to be populated with the numerical value of the Option List Table column 'ID'.  
-- You will see that Option List Tables are joined to the SYNC table by the 'EN' column value

-- Instructions
-- 1. On line 9 update the name of 'DATA_TABLE_NAME' to that of the target table name
-- 2. On lime 11 update the name of 'SYNC_TABLE_NAME' to that of the sync table.  This should exactly match the 'Table name' field on the 'Destination' tab of your data loader task
-- 3. Update the Key that is shared between each table.  Selligent will often use USERID on a data or action list.  If a MAID column is used, it may help to populate that first with a Selligent USERID
-- 4. On line 13 update the name of 'OPTION_TABLE_TEMPLATE' to that of the Option list table you have already created.  If you have not yet created an option list able please refer to: https://github.com/ccestari/Selligent_Templates/blob/master/Create_Option_List_Table
-- 5. Also on Line 13, you can change the table alias (it is currently 'OPTION_LIST1_ALIAS') to something more convienent.  
----  Keep in mind, for every option list able that is added, you will have to have a unique alias.
----  For every alias you assign here, you will have to reference that name in the column update section.
----  Option List tables should be joined on the sync table by the column 'EN'
-- 6. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for each additional Option List being used.  Lines 15 and 16 are in place to demonstrate using multiple option lists.
----  Keep in mind, the join used should be a 'LEFT JOIN'.  This ensures all user records are updated even if the column for the option list is not
----  If there is only 1 Option list being used, you will need to delete lines 15 and 16

-- Updating Columns
-- For lines 4 through 7, you will want to list all columns that can change given a specific record.
-- Do not include the column Key you are matching on in the column updates.  
-- Column updates should be written in the format of DESTINATION_COLUMN_NAME  = SOURCE_COLUMN_NAME
-- Before the equals '=' sign:
-- From the second column on, you will require a comma between column statements.  You can see this begining line 5.
-- It is recommended that you retain the formating as above, beginning each line with a comma and continueing on to the next line after the column update statement
-- 'DST.' should be placed in front of the column name for all columns in the target table - this will avoid potential conflicts if columns have similar names
-- After the equals '=' sign:
-- Columns that originate in the sync file should be proceeded by 'SYNC.'
-- Columns that use an Option list should begin with the table alias you assigned in Instruction 5.  It should be in the form of 'OPTION_LIST_ALIAS.ID'
